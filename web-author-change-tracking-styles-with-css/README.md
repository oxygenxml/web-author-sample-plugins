Web Author Change Tracking Styles Plugin
========================================

Sample plugin that loads a custom CSS file to customize the appearance of **change tracking** markers (**inserted** and **deleted** content) in the editor. The customization applies for all users.

This plugin reuses the same approach/logic as the
[`web-author-change-ui-with-css`](https://github.com/oxygenxml/web-author-sample-plugins/tree/master/web-author-change-ui-with-css)
sample plugin to load CSS into the Web Author page, and demonstrates how the color of change tracking markers can be customized using CSS.
