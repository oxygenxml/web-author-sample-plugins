Oxygen DITA Extensions Bundle Extension
======================================

This projects builds an Oxygen plugin [1] that contributes a DITA framework extension [2] that sets a custom ExtensionsBundle implementation [3] that extends the DITA implementation.
[1] see plugin.xml
[2] see dita-extension.exf
[3] src\main\java\com\oxygenxml\demo\CustomDitaExtensionsBundle.java

You can create a custom DITA extensions bundle where you can override built-in methods. 

Note that it works both for Oxygen XML Web Author and for Oxygen XML Editor (and Oxygen XML Author).
