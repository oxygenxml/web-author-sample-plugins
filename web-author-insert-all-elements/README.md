Web Author Insert All Elements
=================================

The "Insert Element ..." action from contextual menu shows a content completion list that presents only elements that are
valid at caret position.
This sample plugin replaces the "Insert Element ..." action from contextual menu with an action (the one that is executed 
when pressing ENTER) that presents all possible elements when "Show all possible elements in the content completion list" 
option is set to true.
