Web Author Rooms Manager
=================================

Sample plugin that manages rooms*:
- assign each opened file to an already existing room or create one
- if two users open the same document, they will concurrently edit the document
- close rooms that become empty 

*A room is an abstraction for a set of document models created for the same document.
Such models belong to different users and are edited concurrently and synchronized in real-time.
