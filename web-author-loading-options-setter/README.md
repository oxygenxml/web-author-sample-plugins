Web Author Loading Options Setter
=================================

Sample plugin that imposes some loading options depending on the file extension:
 - Files ending in `.dita` open with the "no tags" mode.
 - Files ending in `.ditamap` or `.bookmap` are opened with the **Show topic titles** alternate style activated.
