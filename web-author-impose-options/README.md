Web Author impose options plugin
======================================

Oxygen XML Web Author stores its options in an options.xml file, located in the options folder of the Oxygen Data Directory.
This is a sample plugin for imposing specific options. The "tagless.editor.tags.display.mode" option value is set to 1,
meaning that all the documents are opened with "no tags" mode activated.
